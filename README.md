# Implementing the Clean Architecture

You have very likely heard of Hexagonal Architecture, Onion Architecture or the Clean Architecture.
While talk about this family of architectures is common, it can be hard to find good real-world examples.
This presentation tells the story of how we wrote an application adhering to the Use Case approach of
the Clean Architecture, introducing you to the key concepts and detailing the most important lessons
we learned.

The application discussed is fully open source and can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/wmde/FundraisingFrontend).

## Audience

This presentation is aimed at developers. A good grasp of design fundamentals is helpful, though novice
developers will also benefit from exposure to the included concepts.

The application is a PHP one, however the architecture principles and design techniques discussed are largely
language agnostic, and can therefore easily be applied in other OOP languages.

## Topic list

* Function of the application and reason for its creation
* Our analysis and planning phase (don't worry, it's not Big Design Up Front)
* The Clean Architecture
* High level organization
* Flow of control
* Lessons learned
* Bounded Contexts
